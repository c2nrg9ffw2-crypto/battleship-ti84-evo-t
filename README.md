# Battleship for the TI-84 Evo-T

**Battleship** for the **TI-84 Evo-T** graphing calculator, written in Python.
Play against the calculator, or against a friend on the same calculator.

> **Made with AI:** this game and this README were created with the help of AI (Claude by Anthropic).
> Everything was tested on a real TI-84 Evo-T.

## Features

- **1 player** against the calculator, or **2 players** passing the calculator
- **Place your ships yourself**, or let the calculator place them at random
- A **black screen** between turns in 2-player mode, so nobody sees the other's ships
- **A hit means you fire again**
- Wins stay saved after you quit

## Rules

- Each side has **5 ships**: lengths 5, 4, 3, 3 and 2.
- Take turns firing at a square in the **enemy sea**.
- **Hit** or **sunk**: fire **again**. A **miss** ends your turn.
- Sink **all 5** enemy ships to win.

### Colours

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Blue | Water |
| Grey | Your ship (only in your own sea) |
| Red | Hit |
| Dark red | Sunk ship |
| White dot | Miss |
| Yellow frame | Where you aim |

## What you need

- A **TI-84 Evo-T** calculator
- A USB cable to connect it to your computer
- **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** (Safari and Firefox do not work with the TI tool)
- The file [`ships.py`](ships.py) from this repo

The file is called **ships** because calculator program names can have at most 8 letters.

## Setup

1. Download [`ships.py`](ships.py) to your computer.
2. Connect the calculator to your computer with the USB cable.
   Leave the calculator on the **home screen**.
3. Open **https://connectevo.ti.com** in **Chrome** or **Edge**.
4. Connect to your calculator in the page and allow access when the browser asks.
5. Drag `ships.py` onto the page to send it to the calculator.
6. **Choose RAM** to play right away.
   The Python app on the Evo-T only shows files that are in RAM.
   (Want to keep the game safe? See [Don't lose the game](#dont-lose-the-game).)

> **Already sent it to Archive?** On the **home screen** (not in the Python app) press **2nd → mem → Mem Management**,
> find **SHIPS** and press **enter**. The `*` in front of the name disappears, which means
> it is now in RAM.

## Start the game

1. Open the **Python** app on the calculator.
2. Choose **SHIPS** and run it.
3. Choose **1 player** or **2 players** with ▲ ▼ and press **enter**.
4. Choose **Place ships myself** or **Random ships**.

## Placing your ships

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| ◀ ▶ ▲ ▼ | Move the ship |
| 2nd | Turn the ship (lying ↔ standing) |
| enter | Put the ship down |
| clear | Quit |

The ship is **yellow** where it fits and **red** where it would overlap another ship.

## Firing

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| ◀ ▶ ▲ ▼ | Move the yellow frame in the enemy sea |
| enter | Fire |
| clear | Quit |

## 2 players

1. A **black screen** shows **"PLAYER 1 – Your turn"**. Player 2 looks away, then Player 1 presses **enter**.
2. Each player places their ships, with a black screen in between.
3. In the battle, the black screen comes **after every miss**, before the next player's turn.
4. At the start of your turn, the top line tells you how many hits the other player made in your sea.

## Don't lose the game

The Evo-T **deletes RAM** when it stays turned off for a while.
A normal turn-off is fine, but after some time the game is gone.

**Best way:**

1. Keep the game in **Archive**. Archive is never deleted.
2. Go to the **home screen**. If you are in the Python app, leave it with **2nd → quit**
   (quit is above the **mode** key). In the Python app, **2nd → mem** does nothing.
3. Press **2nd → mem** (mem is above the **+** key) and choose **2: Mem Management**.
4. Choose the list with Python programs (or **All**).
5. Find **SHIPS** and press **enter**. The `*` disappears, which means the game is now in RAM.
6. Open the **Python** app and play.

Programs can't move files between Archive and RAM by themselves, so this step can't be automatic.
The wins list **SHIPS** is in RAM too, so it can be deleted the same way.

## Wins

Wins are saved in a calculator list called **SHIPS**, so they stay after you quit:
your wins and losses against the calculator, and Player 1's and Player 2's wins.
The start screen shows them.

- To reset them, delete the list **SHIPS** in **2nd → mem → Mem Management** (on the home screen).
- A calculator reset (RAM clear) also resets them.

## Good to know

- Keep `ships.py` on your computer too, so you can always send it again.
- Made for the TI-84 Evo-T. Other TI-84 models are not tested.
